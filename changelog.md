# v1.2

This version now offers profiles, with a slight polish and redesign to the extensions UI.

Profiles:

- Cinema: This was already here in the initial release, but has moved into profiles. Cinematic mode provides a cinematic experience by changing the home feed into a cinematic style layout, such as adding a auto rotating video spotlight, and a carousel of videos.

- Focus: Hides Shorts, posts, comments, and notification noise so you can research or study without distractions.

- Minimal: Strips navigation and account surfaces to create a blank, content only experience.

- Compact: Condenses metadata and preview overlays for a tighter browsing surface that surfaces only the essentials.

Eliminates social features, live surfaces, and hover previews so YouTube becomes an ambient background feed.
